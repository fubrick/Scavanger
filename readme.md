# Salvager (a working title) design document

## Description

This is a sci-fi explorer, mystery, survival-horror game. The player controls a ship in the outskirts of developed space. The objective of the game is to explore and find derelict ships, and salvage whatever resources are left so they can live to fly another day. Once you find a ship, your avatar changes to a man with a space suit and jetpack for ships without gravity and just a walking man for ships with the artificial gravity still intact. You then try to find whatever you can of value, and you may even find a quest or storyline. The more you fly around open space, the more your resources will go down, till you have none left and you freeze and the game ends.

## Game objects

The background will be scrolling space, or a derelict ship. Some ships will not have any lights so a flashlight will be required to explore these places, which is where the horror part comes in. Thereâ€™s no telling what our hero will find in the savage corners of the galaxy 

## Sounds

Sci-fi sounds (thrusters, lazers, aliens) and background music.

## Controls

WASD keys, the mouse, tab key for quests and inventory, ect.

## Game flow

We will have a brief explanation of the mission at the beginning of the game, then the player will be off in the ship, looking around for resources.

## Levels

Open space and each ship the player can enter.
